This program receives a file request from the GPAP Genomics Browser and returns 
genomic alignments from the EGA Archive if the user has the necessary permissions in the RD-Connect GPPA



# method access as main endpoint to obtain genomics alignemnts data in RD-Connect GPAP
function getGenomicAlignments(request){

	parse request and extract fileName, chromosome, and position
	
	verify user permissions in the RD-Connect GPAP

	if USER IS AUTHORIZED:
		response = getReads(filename, chromosome, position)
		return response
	else: 
	   return ERROR;


}



# method that returns the genomic alignments by performing a request to EGA
function getReads(filename, chromosome, position):

	request personal token from EGA with authorized credentials for RD-Connect GPAP
	
	IF TOKEN is valid:
		find filename in the list of archived genomics alignements files in EGA
		IF filename has been FOUND:
			download file from EGA
			IF DOWNLOAD is successful:
				send response to client as a octet/stream content-type response
			ELSE
