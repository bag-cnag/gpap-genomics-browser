Integrated Genomics Browser in GPAP

The GPAP Genomics Browser consists of a server and a client application. It relies on the OpenID Connect protocol (KeyCloak, 2021) implemented within the RD-Connect GPAP platform (https://platform.rd-connect.eu/).

The list of instructions performed in the server are written in a pseudocode and can be easily reproduced with standard python libraries such as requests.
The client application is a standalone React Application with an embedded version of the IGV.js browser. It also relies on the authentication system with in OpenID Connect.
